# ZZZ Neko Character Model Ported to S&box
### This repo contains [MToon](https://github.com/edisonlee55/sbox-MToon) which this model uses, and model & material files. The original model and textures were made by [HOYOVERSE](https://www.hoyoverse.com/). Only for studying purposes.

### You need to move these file to the core folder,then you can open it in Model Doc.
#### This model can be use in HL:A and S&box, but I am unsure whether it will work in HL:A. It might also be broken because of the frequent updates of S&box, but it will be fixed eventually.
